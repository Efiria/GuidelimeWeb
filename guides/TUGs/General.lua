This guide is NOT adjusted for any Experience Buff gains(including Heirlooms), but you can still use it with it. Just skip the "grind to level X parts" and drop quests that are really annoying
This guide is NOT meant to be used in Vanilla - Hardcore. It can be used for it, but sometimes I do death-skips, so beware of those :)
